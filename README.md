# Import execution quiz!

Can you guess what the out put for each of these will be? In each directory run the appropriate command:

```shell
python c.py
```

I don't know node well enough to get this part right yet.
```shell
npm install --save-dev @babel/register @babel/preset-env
node start
```

Will the out put be:
A
B
C

or:
